<div class="test-default-content">I just can't get my PI to get a DHCP lease from my BT homehub (3)</p>
<p>I have tried multiple distros, firmware updates, checked voltages, multiple PSUs. SD cards</p>
<p>This thing was driving me INSANE as this PI has been working for me for months with openelec and no problems at all.</p>
<p>When i downed and upped the interface i could just see the PI getting NAKs from the DHCP server which made no sense at all.</p>
<p>In the end I swapped out the BT Homehub for a Draytek router I had laying around and BAM the PI got a lease first time. ( I was glad as the only other thing I had left to swap was my house!! )</p>
<p>I can re create this problem 100% by just swapping the router out and downing and upping the interface again. ( if anyone wants me to capture some traffic I am happy to do so! )</p>
<p>The forum seems full of folks having many odd networking problems so i thought I would share as I dare say there are a LOAD of folks in the UK with BT Homehubs that may have this issue.</p>
<p>So after I came up with my router swap workaround I started Googling in a bit more targeted way.</p>
<p>There seems to be lots of noise about BT homehubs having a hard local LAN device limit of 10 devices, so that is food for thought.</p>
<p>I also found this post:<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bentasker.co.uk&#47;documentation&#47;linux&#47;257-usurping-the-bthomehub-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-two-dns-and-dhcp">http:&#47;&#47;www.bentasker.co.uk&#47;documentatio ... s-and-dhcp<&#47;a><br />
Which talks about BT Homehubs sending out DHCP NAK packets even when DHCP is disabled!!</p>
<p>There are also plenty of posts in the BT communities site talking about DHCP being broken on BT Homehubs.</p>
<p>I know that a good few folks are struggling with network issues, so I post this as just one more thing to try.</p>
