<p>I binge eat.  By that I mean that my eating habits are not healthy and I regularly consume more food than I need or would be considered healthy.  I have probably been a binge eater for most of my life.  I currently don\'t know why I am a binge eater, but I am trying quite hard to come to terms with my \"condition\" (I hate terms like that).</p>
<p>I am trying to follow the self help programme of Dr Christoper Fairburn, from his excellent book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=overcoming%20binge%20eating&amp;tag=jeffaonline&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738\">Overcoming Binge Eating</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=jeffaonline&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2\" style=\"border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />.Ã‚   On the right you will find my Food diary and summary progress sheet, which I will try to keep up to date.  I\'ll also make blog posts where I feel the need.</p>
