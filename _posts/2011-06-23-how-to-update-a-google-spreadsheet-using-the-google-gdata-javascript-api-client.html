<p>Well this has been a journey.</p>
<p>All I wanted to do was to append a row to the bottom of a Google Docs Spreadsheet using Javascript.</p>
<p>I have looked all over for help with this but just keep drawing a blank.Â  Anyway it is either so easy that no one else could be bothered to write it down, or I am terminally dumb.Â  Either way I decided to share what I worked out.</p>
<p>I have set up a demo page <a href="https://jeffarthur.co.uk/GoogleSpreadsheet-JSInsertExample.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Â (sorry about the ssl nag...)</p>
<p>Work your way along the buttons from left to right.Â  As you go you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in into your Google docs account</li>
<li>Check to make sure you are logged in,Â  This should display your login token.</li>
<li>Debug your login, this should show you that you are logged into two scopes (one for docs, one for spreadsheets)</li>
<li>Create a Spreadsheet in your google docs account.</li>
<li>Look up that sheet (to get its unique ID) (this also adds a heading to the top of the first column)</li>
<li>Append a row to your sheet.Â  (you should see the time being added to the first column each time you click the button)</li>
<li>Logout to revoke the access from my webpage to your google docs account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just view the page source to see how it was (badly) done.</p>
<p>I am not claiming that this code is good, or even useful, but it does at least prove that you can insert into a Google spreadsheet with Javascript.</p>
<p>I offer no warranty, if this webpage crashes your dog or eats your car,Â  don't blame me.</p>
<p>If anyone is bothered and/or interested I will go thru the code line by line with some real explanations.Â  Leave a comment if you want me to put the time and effort in.</p>
<p>Update 10/01/2011. Â Fixed this as Google now require https for all Doc API calls. Â Makes sense really. Â Because of the requirement for ssl I have updated the link ftom this post to use SSL to avoid the mixed secure and insecure content issues.</p>
