<div class="test-default-content">
<p>With separate scs instances the scs instance does not get registered in the sld by default (in all versions)</p>
<p>Sapstartsrv will register the details for the scs instance (and any other instances that it knows about) if an slddest.cfg file exists in the instance GLOBAL directory.</p>
<p>You can create this file as sidadm by running this command from the GLOBAL dir</p>
<p>sldreg -configure slddest.cfg &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;usekeyfile</p>
<p>sapstartsrv will only do this on a HARD restart, which means you have to shut the system down and restart sapstartsrv (not just do a startsap; stopsap)</p>
<p>Without this step you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do a managed system config in solman (properly) as the system will fail the pre requisites check.</p>
