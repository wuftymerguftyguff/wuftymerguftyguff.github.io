<p>Was asked by a friend to look at random BSOD problems on a Packard Bell PC.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>Did a bit of work with windbg and the minidumps, but this produced a mixed bag of problems.Ã‚Â  The PC had Norton Av installed, and I was seeing minidumps for navex15.sys, ntkrpamp and nv4_disp.dll.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>Updated norton, same problem.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>Looked into ntkrpamp, looked a bit core for me to be messing with.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>Checked the video card driver, and there was a MUCH later one.Ã‚Â  Also there were a few forum posts talking about problems with BSOD and forceware 84.66, so I updated forceware to the latest version.Ã‚Â  Since the upgrade, no BSODS for a couple of days so far so looking good.</p>
