<p>I have pretty much always been a porker.</p>
<p>I am always keen and interested in just about anything.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; However weighing about 30 stone cuts down the things you can get involved in.</p>
<p>So my task for this year is to lose a shit load of weight, for lots of reasons.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; My back is shafted for one.</p>
<p>To help me with my motivation I am compiliing a list of weight restrictions.</p>
<p>For example a few years ago my friend Damo was learning to dive, but I couldn\'t have a go because I was over 17st (if I recall the limit correctly) .&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; I have always fancied flying lessons, but there are weight limits.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; I can\'t ride a horse, and don\'t want to.</p>
<p>Then as I lose the weight, I will try all the activities on the list.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; The idea is to motivate myself, and to try new things.</p>
<p>So if you know of an activity with a weight limit, please let me know and I\'ll add it to the list.</p>
<p>Like I said I weigh almost 30 stones currently, so some heigh ones would be good, but all will be added to the list, for consideration at least.</p>
