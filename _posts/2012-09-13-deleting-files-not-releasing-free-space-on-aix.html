<div class="test-default-content">If you have deleted lots of files and or in subdirectories but the space has not been freed up when you run a Â df.</div>
<div class="test-default-content"></div>
<div class="test-default-content">This may be due to a loaded shared library holding locks onto an inode that you have deleted.</div>
<div class="test-default-content"></div>
<div class="test-default-content">
<section>When a shared library with read-other permission is loaded, it remains loaded (and available) even if no processes are currently using it. This allows faster execution, but may result in a message like "Cannot open or remove a file containing a running program" on installs or rebuilds of application libraries.</section>
<p>The slibclean command unloads all object files with load and use counts of 0. It can also be used to remove object files that are no longer used<br />
from both the shared library region and in the shared library and kernel text regions by removing object files that are no longer required.</p>
