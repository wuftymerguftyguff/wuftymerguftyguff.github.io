<div class="test-default-content"><strong>Problem</strong><br />
When the BSP "Subscription to Alerts" (ALERTSUBSCRIPTION) or "Personalization" (ALERTPERSONALIZE_RULES) is called, the following error occurs:<br />
Business Server Page (BSP) error<br />
What happened?<br />
Calling the BSP page was terminated due to an error.<br />
SAP Note:<br />
The following error text was processed in the system:<br />
BSP exception: Application sap/alertpersonalize_rules cannot be started. Create an application node using transaction SICF.</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br />
BSPs whose name is longer than 15 characters can not be processed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Implement Note 1038797 in your system, and run the report BSP_UNLOCK_LONG_APP mentioned in that note for the BSPs ALERTPERSONALIZE_RULES and ALERTSUBSCRIPTION.</p>
