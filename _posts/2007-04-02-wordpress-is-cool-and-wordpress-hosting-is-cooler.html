<p>Wordpress really is just the coolest bit of blogging software out there.  Every time I have cause to use it it impresses me more.  I used it hosted free at wordpress, which was great, but it is just so easy to install and use, you just don\'t really get to see that until you use it yourself.  One of my current projects is called <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.webscale.co.uk\" title=\"Webscale Hosting\">Webscale  <&#47;a>This is a website hosting offering that I have put together with a friend Lee Harper.  We can host Wordpress, or pretty much anything else you want, and at very fair rates.  Both Lee and myself are career techies, support does not get any better than this, so if you want something hosting just drop us a mail or leave a comment or sthg.  Will get in touch and see that we can do.</p>
