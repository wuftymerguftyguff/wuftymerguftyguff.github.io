  content: "Jeff cranks out new builds on a brisk schedule!\r\n\r\nI'm testing on
    an iPhone6 and 3 year old iPad2. both running iOS 8.3\r\n\r\nI have set up two
    identities at the GRC test server and switch between them to test and to try features
    like the \"export identity\" function.\r\n\r\nNothing remarkable to report, this
    is just some basic information for what is so far a short comment thread."

    can change between builds. I recognize that my ATT Uverse residential service
    may provide inconsistent performance and many other factors could be involved.\r\nv1.0.248
    (1907) has shown much less camera sensitivity than previous builds."

    Hi John,

    Yes the camera is no where near as snappy.  IS it so slow as to cause issues? or is it just a relative performance thing?

    ta

  content: "Jeff:\r\nNot a major problem, just a noticeable change. It seems that
    this build requires holding the camera lens closer to the screen and giving it
    a few seconds. Earlier builds reacted so fast I was getting accustomed to paying
    little attention to the camera location and was several inches away from the screen."

    place you would prefer to see comments. I don't see a dedicated thread in the
    GRC newsgroups. \r\n\r\nIn any event, I have found that tapping the code on the
    iPhone6 screen and iPad2 screen gets very quick response on the GRC demo site.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the camera sensitivity is very good again with 2046.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    be enrolled in crashalytics on my phone and am getting the notifications about
    new releases.  But I can't seem to get the app on my phone.  Crashalytics keeps
    telling me that \"the developer needs to add this device's UUID to a build\".\r\n\r\nIs
    this just a matter of time and I'll get added in from a list eventually?  Or did
    I not setup my device correctly so you don't actually have my UUID?  \r\n\r\nJust
    want to make sure that there wasn't a mess up on my end.  If its just a matter
    of time then please take your time and focus on developing an amazing app!"

  content: "LOL at the play on words.   \"Your SQRL choked on a stale nut.\"\r\n\r\nI
    did find a repeatable bug.  Log into an existing identity of your choice.  Authenticate
    with that identity.\r\n\r\nNow,  create a new identity from scratch, go through
    that entire process.  After that,  go back,  You will notice your newly created
    identity appears to be selected.  Go back, and attempt to Authenticate.  What
    was supposed to happen, is SQRL was supposed to forget your password hinting,
    \ (ie, touch ID on devices that have it, passcode fallback otherwise), and prompt
    for the newly generated identity password.  Instead, you get the touchID/passcode
    prompt. You proceed with that,  and wham, you are authenticated with the identity
    you were on before.\r\n\r\nAlso worthy of note,  an incorrect passcode entry doesn't
    instantly through you to the SQRL password prompt, as this seems to be an Apple
    API screen.  The only thing that throws you to the SQRL password prompt is cancelling
    out of the touch ID/passcode prompt."

    Not purging keychain on identity change should be fixed in next build.  Please retest.

    at the GRC demo site by tapping the QR code, the sqrl login screen appears promptly

    the sqrl screen remains in view and I am not returned to the GRC demo site at
    that point. Double-tapping the Home button allows me to select the GRC site.\r\n-
    the same flow occurs on an iPhone6 with TouchID.\r\n- on the iPhone6, the option

    there, in the case of creating a new identity from scratch, as as for importing

    somewhere I can view in the app, the current version/build number of the app,
    so that I can absolutely confirm I have the latest one installed for bug testing.
    \ (I did go into crashalytics and installed the latest, but with no visual in
    the app itself, it kind of makes it hard to tell if I have the latest.)"

<p>I am working on an iOS client for SQRL</p>
<p>SQRL is a revolution in waiting being gifted to the world by Steve Gibson of grc.com and Security Now fame.Â  Details of SQRL can be found here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm">https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm</a></p>
<p>The headline here is that with SQRL you can have a secure site specific identity without sharing any secrets (passwords) with the remote site.Â Â Â  This means that even if a remote site is hacked your site specific identity cannot be used to impersonate you.</p>
<p>There is a test server at grc.com here.</p>
<p><a title="Demo Site" href="https://www.grc.com/sqrl/demo.htm">https://www.grc.com/sqrl/demo.htm</a></p>
<p>I need testers for all stages of my development.</p>
<p>If you are interested please sign up here.</p>
<p><a href="http://eepurl.com/bfmQ3z">http://eepurl.com/bfmQ3z</a></p>
<p>(This is a link to a mail chimp signup page)</p>
<p>Alpha testing is being completed using Crashlytics beta. (confusing huh) Â Places are limited.</p>
<p>Beta testing will ultimately takeÂ place with Apple Testflight so the email that needs to be subscribed is the mail from the Apple Id on the device you want to test against.</p>
<p>Lets be clear here...</p>
<p>This is an early version, and not all of the protocol is implemented. We recommend not running this beta software in a production environment.Â  That said your feedback is really important.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Steve Gibson for the mention in Security now episode 510.</p>

<p>Steve uses my client to demonstrate "full magic" login to Leos computer via the Skype connection.</p>
