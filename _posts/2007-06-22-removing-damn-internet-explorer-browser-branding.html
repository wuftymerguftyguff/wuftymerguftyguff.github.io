<p>Had a problem with browser crashing on exit on a Packard Bell with XP SP2.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; IE6 was fully patched up, and no other probs on the machine.</p>
<p>I was pulling my hair out with this problem, getting to the end of my tether.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I noticed that the browser title bar said Packard Bell, not Windows Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>I unbranded the IE by stopping IE and running:</p>
<p>rundll32.exe iedkcs32.dll,Clear</p>
<p>Bingo, problem solved for me.&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&nbsp; Hope this helps someone some day.</p>
<p>You can use this to remove any pesky IE browser branding.</p>
